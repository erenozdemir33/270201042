#Write a program that takes a list of studentâ€™s midterm 1, midterm 2 and final exam grades. Then, it calculates and shows each studentâ€™s average grade by using the weights 30%, 30% and 40%. Average grades are added into a list. 

#Ask the number of students, and take grades:
#i.e.: [[50,90,60],[15,60,75],[99,95,91], ...]
