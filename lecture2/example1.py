#Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?‚óè(Write using input function!)
cover_price = input('Enter your cover price: ')
cover_price = float(cover_price)
discount_version = cover_price - (cover_price * 40) / 100
total_copy = 60
shipping_costs = (total_copy - 1) * 0.75 + 3
total_costs = (float(discount_version) * 60 ) + float(shipping_costs)
print(total_costs)
